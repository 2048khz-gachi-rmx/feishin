# my edits to feishin
originally i intended to fix the more obvious performance issues (try opening the Home page or resizing the queue), but the whole thing is shit from top to bottom (CSS in JS? forced reflows out the ass? are we generating CSS at runtime or something?)  
i gave up, chalking all of it to react and the libraries' terrible performance, and instead settled on tweaking some visual stuff: separators, sizes, layouts, so on.
you can still find the executables in [releases](https://github.com/2048khz-gachi-rmx/feishin/releases)

## Getting Started

### Desktop (recommended)

Download the [latest desktop client](https://github.com/2048khz-gachi-rmx/feishin/releases). The desktop client is the recommended way to use Feishin. It supports both the MPV and web player backends, as well as includes built-in fetching for lyrics.

#### macOS Notes

If you're using a device running macOS 12 (Monterey) or higher, [check here](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/issues/104#issuecomment-1553914730) for instructions on how to remove the app from quarantine.

For media keys to work, you will be prompted to allow Feishin to be a Trusted Accessibility Client. After allowing, you will need to restart Feishin for the privacy settings to take effect.

### Configuration

1. Upon startup you will be greeted with a prompt to select the path to your MPV binary. If you do not have MPV installed, you can download it [here](https://mpv.io/installation/) or install it using any package manager supported by your OS. After inputting the path, restart the app.

2. After restarting the app, you will be prompted to select a server. Click the `Open menu` button and select `Manage servers`. Click the `Add server` button in the popup and fill out all applicable details. You will need to enter the full URL to your server, including the protocol and port if applicable (e.g. `https://navidrome.my-server.com` or `http://192.168.0.1:4533`).

-   **Navidrome** - For the best experience, select "Save password" when creating the server and configure the `SessionTimeout` setting in your Navidrome config to a larger value (e.g. 72h).
    -   **Linux users** - The default password store uses `libsecret`. `kwallet4/5/6` are also supported, but must be explicitly set in Settings > Window > Passwords/secret score.

3. _Optional_ - If you want to host Feishin on a subpath (not `/`), then pass in the following environment variable: `PUBLIC_PATH=PATH`. For example, to host on `/feishin`, pass in `PUBLIC_PATH=/feishin`.

4. _Optional_ - To hard code the server url, pass the following environment variables: `SERVER_NAME`, `SERVER_TYPE` (one of `jellyfin` or `navidrome`), `SERVER_URL`. To prevent users from changing these settings, pass `SERVER_LOCK=true`. This can only be set if all three of the previous values are set.

## FAQ

### MPV is either not working or is rapidly switching between pause/play states

First thing to do is check that your MPV binary path is correct. Navigate to the settings page and re-set the path and restart the app. If your issue still isn't resolved, try reinstalling MPV. Known working versions include `v0.35.x` and `v0.36.x`. `v0.34.x` is a known broken version.

### What music servers does Feishin support?

Feishin supports any music server that implements a [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) API. **Subsonic API is not currently supported**. This will likely be added in [later when the new Subsonic API is decided on](https://support.symfonium.app/t/subsonic-servers-participation/1233).

### I have the issue "The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly" on Linux

This happens when you have user (unprivileged) namespaces disabled (`sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` returns 0). You can fix this by either enabling unprivileged namespaces, or by making the `chrome-sandbox` Setuid.

```bash
chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox
```

Ubunutu 24.04 specifically introduced breaking changes that affect how namespaces work. Please see https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-04-lts-noble-numbat-release-notes/39890#:~:text=security%20improvements%20 for possible fixes.
